---

## Phase 9: Critical Fixes

### 9.1 RLS: Public Restaurant Access
- [x] Add public SELECT policy on `restaurants` table (allows anyone to SELECT, write still owner-only)
- [x] Feedback flow (`/r/[slug]/...`) now works for unauthenticated customers

---

## Phase 10: Polish & Launch Prep

### 10.1 Error Handling
- [x] Global error boundary (`error.tsx`)
- [x] 404 page (`not-found.tsx`)
- [x] User-friendly error messages in Italian
- [x] Loading skeletons for all async content

### 10.2 Landing Page
- [x] Hero section with value proposition
- [x] How it works (3 steps)
- [x] Pricing section (single plan)
- [x] CTA to signup
- [x] Footer with legal links

### 10.3 SEO & Meta
- [x] Per-page meta tags (root layout has basic metadata already)
- [ ] OpenGraph images — add `/public/og-image.png` (1200x630) and uncomment in layout.tsx
- [ ] Favicon — add to `/public` or `src/app/`
- [x] robots.txt
- [x] sitemap.xml

### 10.4 Legal Pages

- [ ] Configure custom domain
- [x] Enable Stripe live mode
- [x] Connected Netlify for auto-deploy

- [ ] Final deployment
- [ ] Monitor for errors

---

## Phase 9.5: Bug Fixes (from code review)

### 9.5.1 Turnstile Token Expiry
- [x] Add `refreshExpired: 'auto'` and `onExpire` handler to TurnstileProvider so token auto-refreshes before expiry

### 9.5.2 Onboarding Slug Race Condition
- [x] Remove redundant pre-INSERT SELECT check for slug uniqueness
- [x] Add live debounced slug availability check with inline status indicator (spinner / green "Disponibile" / red "Già in uso")
- [x] Disable submit button while slug is being checked or is taken
- [x] Catch Postgres `23505` unique violation on INSERT as race condition safety net
- [x] Reset slug auto-generation when restaurant name field is cleared

### 9.5.4 Preview Mode — Reward Page Fix
- [x] Reward page was missing preview mode support — clicking "Continua" on review page redirected to question 1 instead of reward
- [x] Pass `isPreview` through reward page route → RewardClient, skip sessionStorage submission check in preview

### 9.5.3 Preserve Answers on Question Deletion
- [x] Add `is_active` column to `questions` table (soft-delete instead of hard-delete)
- [x] Question delete → `is_active = false` instead of DELETE (preserves FK link to answers)
- [x] Template apply → soft-delete old questions, reactivate matching ones (case-insensitive label + same type)
- [x] Add question → reactivate soft-deleted match if found, otherwise create new
- [x] Filter by `is_active = true` in form builder, feedback flow, dashboard question count
- [x] FeedbackDetailDialog → flip mapping to answers→questions so historical answers always render
- [x] **DB migration required:** `ALTER TABLE public.questions ADD COLUMN is_active boolean DEFAULT true NOT NULL;`

---

## Phase 11: UX Improvements

### 11.1 Preview Mode for Form Testing
- [x] ~~Add preview route~~ — uses `?preview=<signed_token>` query param instead (simpler, no duplicate routes)
- [x] "Anteprima" button in form builder links to form with signed preview token (1-hour expiry)
- [x] Preview submissions NOT saved to database (all Supabase inserts skipped in QuestionPageClient)
- [x] Amber banner "Modalità anteprima — i dati non vengono salvati" shown at top of all feedback pages via `PreviewBanner` in layout

### 11.2 Disable "Avanti" Until Answer Selected
- [x] Disable "Avanti"/"Completa" button until user has provided an answer (except `open_text` which remains optional)
  - `sentiment`: disabled until a sentiment is selected
  - `star_rating`: disabled until a rating is selected
  - `single_choice`: disabled until an option is selected
  - `multiple_choice`: disabled until at least one option is selected
  - `open_text`: always enabled (optional by nature)
- [x] Add tooltip on hover over disabled button: "Completa la domanda per continuare"
- [x] Remove red error message validation — replaced by disabled state

### 11.3 Smart Routing for "OK" Sentiment
> **Decision (2026-04-11):** Instead of removing the "OK" option, keep all 3 sentiments but route "OK" customers to Google when their star ratings suggest they'd leave a 4+ review. Goal: maximize Google reviews without risking 3-star-or-below ratings.

- [x] Save star rating answers to sessionStorage during feedback flow (`feedback_star_ratings` key, keyed by question ID)
- [x] Update review prompt routing: `great` → Google CTA; `ok` + avg star rating ≥ 3.5 → Google CTA; everything else → reward
- [x] Handle edge cases: no star rating questions in form → `ok` skips Google (safe default); user goes back and changes rating → correctly updated via question ID key

### 11.4 Guided Tutorial / Onboarding Tour
> **Decision (2026-04-11):** Skipped — the dashboard is simple enough (5 sidebar items) that a guided tour adds complexity without real value. The QuickStartChecklist already guides new users through setup steps. For B2B with manual onboarding, a walkthrough or video is more effective.

- [x] Replaced with improved QuickStartChecklist: icon button (ListChecks) in top-right of dashboard header with remaining-steps badge, opens dialog with full checklist. Shows until all steps are complete, no dismiss/localStorage needed

### 11.5 Default Template for New Users
- [x] Set "Quick & Simple" (2 questions) as default template for new users during onboarding — already implemented in onboarding page

---

## Phase 12: Google Reviews Tracking

> **Design decisions (discussed 2026-04-08):**
> - Google is THE primary review platform — always primary, not configurable. Other platforms (TripAdvisor, TheFork, etc.) remain as optional secondary links
> - Remove `primary_platform` toggle from settings — Google is hardcoded as primary
> - Google Place ID setup happens during onboarding (not later in settings) — user searches by restaurant name via Places Autocomplete, picks their restaurant, baseline snapshot captured immediately
> - Skippable but strongly discouraged — clear copy explaining they'll lose before/after tracking
> - Dashboard nudge banner if Google not connected
> - Daily cron via Netlify Scheduled Function → calls `/api/cron/review-snapshots` API route
> - All Places API calls server-side only, single API key

### 12.1 Schema & API Setup
- [x] Create `review_snapshots` table: `id`, `restaurant_id` (FK), `fetched_at`, `rating` (numeric 2,1), `review_count` (int), `recent_reviews` (jsonb), `is_baseline` (bool). Index on `(restaurant_id, fetched_at DESC)`. RLS: owner SELECT only, writes via admin client
- [x] Set up Google Places API key (`GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` env var, server-side only) — done (no restrictions yet, on main Google account)
- [x] Create server-side utility to call Places API (Autocomplete + Place Details) — `src/lib/google-places.ts`
- [x] Create shared Supabase admin client — `src/lib/supabase/admin.ts`
- [x] API routes: `/api/google/autocomplete`, `/api/google/place-details`, `/api/google/baseline-snapshot`

### 12.2 Onboarding: Google Place Setup
- [x] Add new onboarding step after slug: "Trova il tuo ristorante su Google"
- [x] Search input using Places Autocomplete API (filtered: restaurants + Italy), show dropdown suggestions
- [x] On selection: show confirmation card (name, address, current rating + stars, photo if available)
- [x] On confirm: save Place ID to `social_links.google`, fetch Place Details, store baseline snapshot (`is_baseline = true`)
- [x] Skip option: "Non trovo il mio ristorante" / "Non sono ancora su Google" — clear messaging about losing before/after comparison
- [x] After this step → redirect to dashboard
- [x] Step indicator (1 of 2, 2 of 2) + back button

### 12.3 Daily Cron Job
- [x] API route: `/api/cron/review-snapshots` — protected by `CRON_SECRET` header
- [x] Logic: fetch all restaurants with `social_links->>'google'` set, call Place Details for each, insert snapshot rows
- [x] Netlify Scheduled Function: thin trigger at 3:00 AM UTC daily — `netlify/functions/daily-review-snapshots.mts`
- [ ] Add `CRON_SECRET` env var to Netlify — **user manual step**

### 12.4 Dashboard: Google Reviews Section
- [x] Current Google rating (large display) + delta since baseline
- [ ] Rating trend chart over time (baseline marked as "Inizio 5stelle") — deferred until enough data points exist
- [x] Review count growth (now vs baseline)
- [x] Baseline reference with tracking start date
- [x] If Google not connected: nudge banner "Collega il tuo ristorante a Google per monitorare le tue recensioni"

### 12.5 Settings: Google Section Update
- [ ] Replace current Google Place ID input with the same search widget from onboarding — deferred (current manual input works)
- [ ] Show current linked restaurant (name, address, rating) with option to change — deferred
- [x] Remove `primary_platform` star toggle — Google is always primary

### 12.6 Review Prompt Screen Update
- [x] Google always shown as primary CTA (animated gold border)
- [x] Other configured review platforms shown as secondary buttons below
- [x] Remove primary_platform logic, hardcode Google

### 12.7 Review Prompt Click/View Tracking + Attribution
> Implemented 2026-04-10. Tracks how many customers see the review prompt, how many click the Google CTA, and cross-references with new reviews from daily snapshots to estimate reviews driven by 5stelle.

- [x] **DB migration:** Add 3 columns to `submissions` table (migration already run)
- [x] Update `src/types/database.types.ts` — add 3 fields to submissions Row/Insert/Update
- [x] Update `src/components/feedback/ReviewPromptClient.tsx` — track view on mount, first click wins with platform key, skipped in preview
- [x] Update dashboard page — query `review_prompt_shown_at IS NOT NULL` + `review_platform_clicked = 'google'`, pass to GoogleReviewsCard
- [x] Update `src/components/dashboard/GoogleReviewsCard.tsx` — attribution section with prompt views, Google clicks, `min(googleClicks, newReviews)` estimate

### 12.8 Landing Page Copy Update
- [x] Rewrite hero/value prop to lead with Google Reviews ("Più recensioni a 5 stelle su Google")
- [x] Add before/after tracking visual in Step 3 dashboard illustration (baseline → current rating with growth)
- [x] Google as primary in routing visual (large card with gold border, secondary platforms smaller)
- [x] Updated pain point, features, stats, pricing, and CTA copy to reference Google specifically
- [x] "Monitoraggio Google Reviews" replaces "Dashboard analytics" in feature cards and pricing list

---

## Phase 13: Pre-Production Checklist

### 13.1 Environment & Security
- [ ] Add `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` and `CRON_SECRET` to Netlify env vars
- [ ] Add API restrictions to Google Places API key (Places API New only) + application restrictions
- [ ] Google Cloud project is on main account — consider moving to separate account later
- [ ] Update Supabase Auth URL config — change Site URL from `localhost` to `https://5stelle.app` + add redirect URLs
- [ ] Decide on email confirmation for signups (currently disabled — fine for B2B manual onboarding, risky if public signups)

---

## Known Issues

- **Duplicate sentiment question** — User reported seeing duplicate sentiment question in feedback flow. Likely a data issue (duplicate question rows in DB), not a code bug. Check with: `SELECT id, label, type, order_index, is_active FROM questions WHERE form_id = '<FORM_ID>' ORDER BY order_index;`
